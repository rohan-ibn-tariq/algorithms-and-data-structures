# Fibonacci Sequence Problem

## Problem Statement

Write a function that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## Definition

```
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1  
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
```

## Sequence
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
```

## Example

**Input:** n = 5  
**Output:** 5  
**Explanation:** F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 3 + 2 = 5
